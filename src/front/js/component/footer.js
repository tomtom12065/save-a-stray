								Welcome to Save a Stray ("Platform," "we," "our," or "us"). By accessing or using our website, you ("User," "you") agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Platform.

								Save a Stray is a digital platform designed to facilitate connections between individuals seeking to adopt or rehome pets. **We do not house, care for, or own any of the pets listed on our website. We are not a kennel, rescue organization, or adoption agency.** All pet listings, communications, and transactions are the sole responsibility of the users involved.

								We do not verify the accuracy of pet listings or the backgrounds of adopters and pet owners. All interactions, negotiations, and exchanges of pets or funds are strictly between the involved users. **We do not guarantee the health, behavior, temperament, or breed authenticity of any listed pets.** We are not liable for any disputes, losses, damages, or fraudulent activity resulting from user interactions.

								Users are responsible for conducting their own due diligence before adopting, rehoming, or listing pets. We strongly encourage in-person meetings, vet references, and legal documentation to ensure a safe and ethical adoption process. Additionally, users must ensure that any pet adoption, sale, or rehoming complies with applicable local, state, and federal laws.

								Save a Stray does not endorse any specific pet owners, adopters, shelters, or organizations using the platform. Any views, statements, or actions of users on the platform are their own and do not reflect the views of Save a Stray. Users must comply with all relevant laws and regulations regarding pet ownership, adoption, and transfer. We are not responsible for any legal disputes or regulatory violations resulting from transactions made through the platform.

								User data is collected and stored in accordance with our [Privacy Policy]. We do not sell or distribute user data to third parties without consent. While we take reasonable measures to protect user information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Payments facilitated through third-party services (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) are not stored by us, and we are not responsible for any payment disputes, chargebacks, or fraudulent transactions between users.

								Users agree not to list stolen, sick, or dangerous animals; engage in deceptive or fraudulent activity; use the platform for illegal or unethical pet trade (e.g., dogfighting, puppy mills, scams); harass, threaten, or harm other users; or post false or misleading information.

								To the fullest extent permitted by law, Save a Stray is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the platform. We do not provide warranties or guarantees of any kind regarding the service. Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless Save a Stray, its owners, employees, and affiliates from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from their use of the platform.

								We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us at [Your Contact Information].</p>
